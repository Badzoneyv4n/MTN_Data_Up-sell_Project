    "# ðŸ“Š Model Comparison Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "I trained and compared two classification models â€” Random Forest as a baseline model and XGBoost â€” to predict which new smartphone users will to increase their data usage after an upgrade. The goal was to identify high-potential users for targeted upsell campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# âœ… 1. Random Forest (Baseline Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test Precision: 1.0000\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test AUC-ROC: 0.8750\n",

    "\n",
    "**ðŸ§  Insight:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model provided strong performance with perfect precision and good AUC. It used multiple features and showed a relatively balanced reliance across them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# âœ… 2. XGBoost (Final Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test Precision: 1.0000\n",

    "\n",
    "**ðŸ§  Insight:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The XGBoost model outperformed the baseline in terms of AUC-ROC, indicating a stronger ability to rank users by growth potential. It relied almost entirely on just two key features, making it highly efficient and easy to interpret.\n",
