# 📱 MTN Data Upsell Project

This machine learning project was created to support data-driven marketing strategies at MTN by identifying new smartphone users who are most likely to increase their data usage after upgrading from a feature phone. The final model aims to guide targeted campaign offers and improve customer engagement through smart segmentation.

## 🔍 Project Phases

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Define upgrade cohort (IMEI/device change)
   - Extract recharge, usage, and MoMo behavior

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Segment users: non-users, low adopters, high adopters
   - Visualize data trends and usage growth

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create behavioral features (e.g., recharge growth, time to first use)

4. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Train classification model (RandomForest, XGBoost, etc.)
   - Target users likely to increase data usage by 50%+

5. **Recommendation & Targeting**
   - Generate user scores and action flags
   - Prepare `data_upsell_targets.csv` for campaign design

6. **Reporting**
   - Present findings and final deliverables
